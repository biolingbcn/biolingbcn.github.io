title: Things I would tell my first-year-university-student-self

I asked my friends and colleagues what advice they would give to their younger selves at the beginning of their university years. I got an interesting mix of responses. What seems to stand out is that the people I asked, most of whom were in their late twenties and early thirties, generally encouraged their younger selves to be more serious and work harder. Maybe I would have gotten very different responses if I had asked people who are now in their 60s and 70s. The people that I asked are currently facing the challenges of finding jobs they like, making money, surviving in society as real, full-blown adults. The advice they give to themselves seems to reflect the struggles that our generation faces in society and professional life. 

##### Social life outside of uni
Before I started uni, I was told by everyone that this was going to be a great time of my life, that I should enjoy it, etc. I did my B.A. in Germany, which means that it was completely free of cost, so I guess that contributes to the average German's attitude towards starting a degree. I personally would not have needed to be told to party more, rather the opposite, an occasional reminder that the grades early on in your career might actually matter some day (especially when moving from one country and it's university system into another...), but other people I spoke to apparently regret not having made use of their early university freedom more. Here is a little summary of what people told me: 
* Don't drink too much
* Don't party too much
* Study more
* Your bachelor’s is not the last time in life you will get the chance to meet new people and make new friends
* Meet as many different people you can
* Don't be afraid to try to become a new person

##### Social life at uni (a tricky one)
Navigating the social sub-world of academia is a never-ending challenge, I guess. After a few years everyone seems to know more or less what it is all about, and I mean the depressing stuff, like networking (even though you can't stand the other peoples' guts), competiing for funding, stealing ideas, arguing about author orders, all those things. When you just start university, these are not yet the problems you face. Here is what people wanted to tell their younger selves: 
* Relationships with teachers are very important and have a great impact on you
* Ask older students for advice
* Talk to lecturers as much as you can
* Do work placements and engage in societies/volunteering
* The people above you in the hierarchy are people too (don’t be afraid of them, don’t treat them like shit)
* Teachers can see when you are typing on your phone under the table and they think it is rude
* Be professional
* Join (and take part in) clubs/societies that interest you, even if none of your friends do. You’ll meet cool people there!


Choosing the right subject
Choose the field that interests you the most
If you want university to be your job, don’t try to turn your hobby into your job. Save your hobby for yourself
Study more broadly
Drop a class after the first two weeks if you realise it’s not for you
Don’t be afraid of “difficult” subjects
Write down the reasons you are going/applying to university/this university/this course. Then ask yourself if the reasons are good enough to justify it. If not, do something else
You don’t have to go to university to have an interesting life/job/be educated
A lot of bullshit is happening at university. University is a beautiful but mostly useless tree full of branches that end nowhere in particular
You don’t have to know where you want to be in 10 years. You will find out anyway
You have more options than you think



Skills outside your subject
Study computer science
Learn programming
Get involved with university projects that involve the "real" world, be that workshops, charity, internships, etc.
Don’t be fooled into thinking university prepares you for the job market


How to study
Learn to make a good argument
People “develop” ideas, they don’t just “have” them
Nobody really cares about the grade
Grades count, even the early ones. They will come back to haunt you when you least expect it
Go abroad
Look for interesting opportunities as they're not always widely advertised
Practice presentations often. Take seminar presentations serious as practicing ground
Take yourself and your work seriously
Treat university as a job
University is not a synonym for education. You have to educate yourself, university will not educate you
Go beyond (outside of class, not for the usual class work) what a teacher tells you to do: research on your own the things you find fascinating


Money and jobs
Ask for money. There are lots of funds that are not used
Having a job on the side will remind you what life is like in the real world
Get work experience during your studies
Enjoy not having a real job as long as you can
Try to get a grant. Even a small grant is a good grant
