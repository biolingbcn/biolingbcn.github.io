We asked our friends and colleagues what advice they would give to their younger selves at the beginning of their university years. We got an interesting mix of responses. What seems to stand out is that the people we asked, most of whom were in their late twenties and early thirties, generally encouraged their younger selves to be more serious and work harder. Maybe we would have gotten very different responses if we had asked people in their 60s and 70s. The people that we asked are currently facing the challenges of finding jobs they like, making money, surviving in society as real, full-blown adults. The advice they give to themselves seems to reflect the struggles that our generation faces in society and professional life.
