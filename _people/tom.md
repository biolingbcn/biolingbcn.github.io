Tom is interested in the evolution of cognitive capacities that converge in language. He is currently researching the evolution of memory systems, the genetic basis of modern humansâ€™ semantic memory systems, and the extent to which structures involved in semantic memory may be shared with other species. He also likes electronic music, dogs, and discussing recycling.
