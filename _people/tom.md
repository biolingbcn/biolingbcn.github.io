Tom is interested in the evolution of cognitive capacities that converge in language. He is currently working on the influence of chronic stress or lack thereof on the evolution of modern human cognition, and by being a PhD student he is also a case study in itself for the effects of chronic stress on general state of mind. He also likes electronic music, dogs, and discussing recycling.
