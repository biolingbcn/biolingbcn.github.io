Cedric is the principal investigator of the Cognitive Biology of Language group. He used to work as a theoretical linguist but then turned his ship around a bit and is now doing interdisciplinary research with a strong biological focus - he is still interested in language and the brain, though. He is an active Twitter user, so if you want to know more, it's best to head over to his profile there. He also likes football, but he doesn't share that with his Twitter followers.
