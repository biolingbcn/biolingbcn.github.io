Pedro is one of the longest-standing members of our research group. He can take credit for / be blamed for many of the things that have happened and are happening in the Biolinguistics Initiative Barcelona. He is a heterosexual real scientist. People don't recognise him when he shaves his beard. He likes funny animals, heavy music and matcha.
