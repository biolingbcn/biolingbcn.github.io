We are PhD students of the Biolinguistics Initiative Barcelona, a research group at the University of Barcelona led by Cedric Boeckx. We are from different countries and we have different ages, genders, hair colours, body types, diets, and academic/non-academic interests. Here, we would like to express our personal views on the things that we deal with in our life as PhD students.
