We are PhD students of the [Biolinguistics Initiative Barcelona](http://bioling.ub.edu), a research group at the University of Barcelona headed by [Cedric Boeckx](http://bioling.ub.edu/index.php/people/cedric-boeckx/). We are from different countries and we have different ages, genders, hair colours, body types, diets, and academic/non-academic interests. Here, we would like to express our personal views on the things that we deal with in our life as PhD students.
