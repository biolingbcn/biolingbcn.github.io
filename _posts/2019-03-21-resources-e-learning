title: Online resources I use to fight my impostor syndrome
excerpt: I compiled a small list of recommendations for the topics that have been relevant to me in my attempt to study the evolution of human cognition (so far). All of these are high-quality resources and they are online and free.

Interdisciplinary research is all very nice, but it can leave you feeling utterly insufficient with whatever training you have. I have spent the last three years of my life jumping back and forth between linguistics, neuroscience, psychology, philosophy, computer science, biology, and archaeology, trying to learn to understand the work of either of these disciplines (with varying degrees of success), and more often than not it gave me the feeling that I would never know enough. 
I guess we need to overcome this sort of thought, because after all, we only have two options: try or not try. Many of the classes that I have attended in interdisciplinary programmes were very much hands-on, learning by doing, top-down learning based. I tried to balance this by going through some background materials by myself. For my personal impostor anxiety, the best antidote I have found so far is taking a step back and letting some solid foundational classes put everything that I have learned into order.

### [Introduction to genetics and evolution](https://www.coursera.org/learn/genetics-evolution) by Dr Mohamed Noor from Duke University. 

This class goes through the basics of genetic variation, inheritance, evolutionary principles, etc. It assumes no prior knowledge and the instructor, Mohamed Noor, is absolutely excellent at explaining things. He takes nothing for granted but still goes into a level of detail that makes it possible to understand the processes he talks about in a precise and quantifyable way.
