Hi! 

We are a group of PhD students at the University of Barcelona and although we (most days) love what we do and academia and all, we sometimes feel like we would like to be able to speak about the topics that we encounter in our everyday life in a more natural, relaxed way. These could be scientific topics as well as inter-personal, social, political, etc. issues. At university we are all trained to always try to sound as smart as possible, to always make sure to not say anything wrong, and so on and so forth. We think that on a blog, you are allowed to be a bit more shitty, basically, and to say things as you mean them, not as you should say them. So if you think this sounds interesting (keep in mind all of us are geniuses), this will be the place for you!

P.S. We love comments.
