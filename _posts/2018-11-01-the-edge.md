title: What should I read from the field of... engineering?
subtitle: Looking beyond the edge of your plate - getting to know other disciplines
author: Stefanie
excerpt: In my native language, German - which in my opinion is a beautiful but in circles that don't idolise certain philosophers highly underappreciated language - we say that it is important to "look beyond the edge of your plate", referring to the plate that you eat your food from, which in the German language seems to be a logical metaphor to describe your own comfort zone. When we say this, we mean that it is important to not only move wherever you feel cozy, wherever it is "gemütlich", but to also try to seek out new things, get to know new perspectives, think outside the box of your own daily life...

In my native language, German - which in my opinion is a beautiful but in circles that don't idolise certain philosophers highly underappreciated language - we say that it is important to "look beyond the edge of your plate", referring to the plate that you eat your food from, which in the German language seems to be a logical metaphor to describe your own comfort zone. When we say this, we mean that it is important to not only move wherever you feel cozy, wherever it is "gemütlich", but to also try to seek out new things, get to know new perspectives, think outside the box of your own daily life. 

With this in mind, I want to ask people from other fields than my own (whatever that is supposed to be anyway) what papers they would like me to read, if I only read one single paper from their field. To show how serious I am about this challenge, the first person I asked comes from a field that could hardly be more intimidating to an outsider: engineering.
