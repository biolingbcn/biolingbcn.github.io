title: How to be a university student 101
excerpt: I asked my friends and colleagues what advice they would give to their younger selves at the beginning of their university years. I got an interesting mix of responses. What seems to stand out is that the people I asked, most of whom were in their late twenties and early thirties, generally encouraged their younger selves to be more serious and work harder. Maybe I would have gotten very different responses if I had asked people who are now in their 60s and 70s. The people that I asked are currently facing the challenges of finding jobs they like, making money, surviving in society as real, full-blown adults. The advice they give to themselves seems to reflect the struggles that our generation faces in society and professional life.

I asked my friends and colleagues what advice they would give to their younger selves at the beginning of their university years. I got an interesting mix of responses. What seems to stand out is that the people I asked, most of whom were in their late twenties and early thirties, generally encouraged their younger selves to be more serious and work harder. Maybe I would have gotten very different responses if I had asked people who are now in their 60s and 70s. The people that I asked are currently facing the challenges of finding jobs they like, making money, surviving in society as real, full-blown adults. The advice they give to themselves seems to reflect the struggles that our generation faces in society and professional life.

##### Social life outside of uni
Before I started uni, I was told by everyone that this was going to be a great time of my life, that I should enjoy it, etc. I did my B.A. in Germany, which means that it was completely free of cost, so I guess that contributes to the average German's attitude towards starting a degree. I personally would not have needed to be told to party more, rather the opposite, an occasional reminder that the grades early on in your career might actually matter some day (especially when moving from one country and it's university system into another...), but other people I spoke to apparently regret not having made use of their early university freedom more. Here is a little summary of what people told me: 
* Don't drink too much
* Don't party too much
* Study more
* Your bachelor’s is not the last time in life you will get the chance to meet new people and make new friends
* Meet as many different people you can
* Don't be afraid to try to become a new person

##### Social life at uni (a tricky one)
Navigating the social sub-world of academia is a never-ending challenge, I guess. After a few years everyone seems to know more or less what it is all about, and I mean the depressing stuff, like networking (even though you can't stand the other peoples' guts), competiing for funding, stealing ideas, arguing about author orders, all those things. When you just start university, these are not yet the problems you face. Here is what people wanted to tell their younger selves: 
* Relationships with teachers are very important and have a great impact on you
* Ask older students for advice
* Talk to lecturers as much as you can
* Do work placements and engage in societies/volunteering
* The people above you in the hierarchy are people too (don’t be afraid of them, don’t treat them like shit)
* Teachers can see when you are typing on your phone under the table and they think it is rude
* Be professional
* Join (and take part in) clubs/societies that interest you, even if none of your friends do. You’ll meet cool people there!

##### Choosing the right subject
This is a **very** tricky one. Everyone seems to have their own take on this. I was told to pick something I really like, and that meant in my case that I chose what seemed easiest to me. That's one way of doing it, but being afraid of challenges is not great, I'd say. Overall, people's advice seemed to say: Don't just do things brainlessly. Think about your decisions. Except when you don't know what to do - in that case, do the complete opposite!
* Choose the field that interests you the most
* If you want university to be your job, don’t try to turn your hobby into your job. Save your hobby for yourself
* Study more broadly
* Drop a class after the first two weeks if you realise it’s not for you
* Don’t be afraid of "difficult" subjects. You are smart, you can learn (almost) anything (maybe everything)
* Write down the reasons you are going/applying to university/this university/this course. Then ask yourself if the reasons are good enough to justify it. If not, do something else
* You don’t have to go to university to have an interesting life/job/be educated
* A lot of bullshit is happening at university. University is a beautiful but mostly useless tree full of branches that end nowhere in particular
* You don’t have to know where you want to be in 10 years. You will find out anyway
* You have more options than you think

##### Shoe-shining that CV
If, like me, you have a humanities background, or are thinking about studying something in the humanities, I am sure you have come across that thing where people tell you to learn some useful stuff "on the side" of your studies, like internships, or Python, or starting a fashion blog. In my first year of linguistics, we were told that a great alternative job prospect for humanities people, in the likely case that they won't find work in academia, was "becoming a fiction writer" (it was not a joke, I think). I used to think this problem was somehow specific to the humanities, but the more people from other disciplines I meet, the more I realise many people feel like that, because uni classes tend to be quite far away from reality. Here's what people with all sorts of backgrounds, including biology, psychology, and medicine, told me: 
* Study computer science
* Learn programming
* Get involved with university projects that involve the "real" world, be that workshops, charity, internships, etc.
* Don’t be fooled into thinking university prepares you for the job market

##### How to study
Some of the advice that people would like to give their rosy-cheeked, pimple-nosed, enthusiastic selves of the past was related to how to actually study, which can be quite a painful process to find out. The bad news is: It seems really tough to convey. Most advice sounds quite vague, and to be fair I doubt that I would have understood what exactly people meant by this, if someone would have told me back in the day. My gut feeling tells me this is something that one has to truly find out for themselves... But let's give it a go, anyway!
* Learn to make a good argument
* People “develop” ideas, they don’t just “have” them
* Nobody really cares about the grade 
But also...
* Grades count, even the early ones. They will come back to haunt you when you least expect it
* Go abroad
* Look for interesting opportunities as they're not always widely advertised
* Practice presentations often. Take seminar presentations serious as practicing ground
* Take yourself and your work seriously
* Treat university as a job
* University is not a synonym for education. You have to educate yourself, university will not educate you
* Go beyond what a teacher tells you to do: research the things you find fascinating on your own

##### Money and jobs
And last but not least, a few words on the financial side of business. This stuff of course depends hugely on the country we are talking about. Germany is quite nice for this, since really a lot of stuff is free, something that I have come to properly appreciate only after leaving the country. But on the other hand, especially in the infamous UK (fingers crossed about that Brexit thing, by the way), there's more money floating around than you might think. Universities, even here in Spain, sometimes have funds that are reserved for specific purposes, and since people don't know about them, they just get lost and forgotten. Even if they ask you to pay for an enrollment certificate (which might make you think they must be really, really broke), there may be an untouched fund for paying some conference attendance fee for you (or even for buying a coffee maker). Also, working on the side is something many people recommend, because you come out of uni better prepared for the real world. But at the same time, your grades may suffer because you are too stressed to study properly. So, along these lines... 
* Ask for money. There are lots of funds that are not used
* Having a job on the side will remind you what life is like in the real world
* Get work experience during your studies
* Enjoy not having a real job as long as you can
* Try to get a grant. Even a small grant is a good grant

People told me all of these things without me asking for specific topics. I just asked them what they would like to tell their younger selves. The kind of things people told me are overall strikingly sober and concerned with money and the job market. This says more about the post-PhD, academic midlife crisis that my friends are in than about what you should do when you start your studies. Oh, well. It's a tough life.
